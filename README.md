This TypeScript project is a simple calculator application. It provides basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The calculator uses HTML buttons for user input. Each button represents a number or an operation. The user's input is displayed on the screen, and the result of the operation is shown when the equals button is clicked.

The calculator also includes error handling for division by zero and invalid operators.

The Calculator function is the main function that initializes the calculator by setting up the event listeners for the buttons.
